A project assessing factors associated with online news popularity in accordance with DSCI 522 (Data Science Workflows) for the Master of Data Science Program at the University of British Columbia.

## Project Abstract

The market space for online news has grown manifold, with traditional news outlets also providing an online version of their articles. This growth has been complemented with increased competition, particularly from non-traditional news outlets (such as small-scale digital news companies) who can reach a wider audience through social-media. For this project we aim to answer the following inferential research question: **What factors are associated with online news popularity, measured by the number of times an article has been shared?**. 

(Add information about results here.)

Our findings are relevant to news organizations that are interested in boosting traction of their online news articles and would help guide management decisions on the characteristics associated with more popular articles.
